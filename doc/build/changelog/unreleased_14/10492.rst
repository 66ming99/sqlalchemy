    Repaired a new incompatibility in the MySQL "pre-ping" routine where the
    ``False`` argument passed to ``connection.ping()``, which is intended to
    disable an unwanted "automatic reconnect" feature,  is being deprecated in
    MySQL drivers and backends, and is producing warnings for some versions of
    MySQL's native client drivers.  It's removed for mysqlclient, whereas for
    PyMySQL and drivers based on PyMySQL, the parameter will be deprecated and
    removed at some point, so API introspection is used to future proof against
    these various stages of removal.
