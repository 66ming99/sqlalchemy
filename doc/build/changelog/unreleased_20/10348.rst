    Added new capability to the :func:`_orm.selectin_polymorphic` loader option
    which allows other loader options to be bundled as siblings, referring to
    one of its subclasses, within the sub-options of parent loader option.
    Previously, this pattern was only supported if the
    :func:`_orm.selectin_polymorphic` were at the top level of the options for
    the query.   See new documentation section for example.

    As part of this change, improved the behavior of the
    :meth:`_orm.Load.selectin_polymorphic` method / loader strategy so that the
    subclass load does not load most already-loaded columns from the parent
    table, when the option is used against a class that is already being
    relationship-loaded.  Previously, the logic to load only the subclass
    columns worked only for a top level class load.
