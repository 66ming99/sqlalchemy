    The :class:`.Values` construct will now automatically create a proxy (i.e.
    a copy) of a :class:`_sql.column` if the column were already associated
    with an existing FROM clause.  This allows that an expression like
    ``values_obj.c.colname`` will produce the correct FROM clause even in the
    case that ``colname`` was passed as a :class:`_sql.column` that was already
    used with a previous :class:`.Values` or other table construct.
    Originally this was considered to be a candidate for an error condition,
    however it's likely this pattern is already in widespread use so it's
    now added to support.
