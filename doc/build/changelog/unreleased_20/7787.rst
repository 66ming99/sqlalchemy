    Added an option to permanently close sessions.
    Set to ``False`` the new parameter :paramref:`_orm.Session.close_resets_only`
    will prevent a :class:`_orm.Session` from performing any other
    operation after :meth:`_orm.Session.close` has been called.

    Added new method :meth:`_orm.Session.reset` that will reset a :class:`_orm.Session`
    to its initial state. This is an alias of :meth:`_orm.Session.close`,
    unless :paramref:`_orm.Session.close_resets_only` is set to ``False``.
