    Fixed regression in recently revised "insertmanyvalues" feature (likely
    issue :ticket:`9618`) where the ORM would inadvertently attempt to
    interpret a non-RETURNING result as one with RETURNING, in the case where
    the ``implicit_returning=False`` parameter were applied to the mapped
    :class:`.Table`, indicating that "insertmanyvalues" cannot be used if the
    primary key values are not provided.

.. change::
    :tags: bug, engine

    Fixed issue within some dialects where the dialect could incorrectly return
    an empty result set for an INSERT statement that does not actually return
    rows at all, due to artfacts from pre- or post-fetching the primary key of
    the row or rows still being present.  Affected dialects included asyncpg,
    all mssql dialects.
