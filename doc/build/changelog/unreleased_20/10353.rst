    Repaired the core "SQL element" class ``SQLCoreOperations`` to support the
    ``__hash__()`` method from a typing perspective, as objects like
    :class:`.Column` and ORM :class:`.InstrumentedAttribute` are hashable and
    are used as dictionary keys in the public API for the :class:`_dml.Update`
    and :class:`_dml.Insert` constructs.  Previously, type checkers were not
    aware the root SQL element was hashable.
