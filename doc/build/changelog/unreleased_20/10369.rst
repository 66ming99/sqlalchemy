    Fixed a wide range of :func:`_orm.mapped_column` parameters that were not
    being transferred when using the :func:`_orm.mapped_column` object inside
    of a pep-593 ``Annotated`` object, including
    :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.sort_order`,
    :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.deferred`,
    :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.autoincrement`,
    :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.system`, :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.info`
    etc.

    Additionally, it remains not supported to have dataclass arguments, such as
    :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.kw_only`,
    :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.default_factory` etc. indicated within the
    :func:`_orm.mapped_column` received by ``Annotated``, as this is not
    supported with pep-681 Dataclass Transforms.  A warning is now emitted when
    these parameters are used within ``Annotated`` in this way (and they
    continue to be ignored).
