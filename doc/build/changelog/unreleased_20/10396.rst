    Modified the mariadb-connector driver to pre-load the ``cursor.rowcount``
    value for all queries, to suit tools such as Pandas that hardcode to
    calling :attr:`.Result.rowcount` in this way. SQLAlchemy normally pre-loads
    ``cursor.rowcount`` only for UPDATE/DELETE statements and otherwise passes
    through to the DBAPI where it can return -1 if no value is available.
    However, mariadb-connector does not support invoking ``cursor.rowcount``
    after the cursor itself is closed, raising an error instead.  Generic test
    support has been added to ensure all backends support the allowing
    :attr:`.Result.rowcount` to succceed (that is, returning an integer
    value with -1 for "not available") after the result is closed.

    Additional fixes for the mariadb-connector dialect to support UUID data
    values in the result in INSERT..RETURNING statements.
