    :tags: orm, usecase
    :tickets: 10202

    Added method :meth:`_orm.Session.get_one` that behaves like
    :meth:`_orm.Session.get` but raises an exception instead of returning
    ``None`` if no instance was found with the provided primary key.

.. change::
    :tags: asyncio, bug

    Fixed the :paramref:`_asyncio.AsyncSession.get.execution_options` parameter
    which was not being propagated to the underlying :class:`_orm.Session` and
    was instead being ignored.
