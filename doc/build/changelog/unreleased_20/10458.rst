    Fixed bug where the rule that prevents ORDER BY from emitting within
    subqueries on SQL Server was not being disabled in the case where the
    :meth:`.select.fetch` method were used to limit rows in conjunction with
    WITH TIES or PERCENT, preventing valid subqueries with TOP / ORDER BY from
    being used.
