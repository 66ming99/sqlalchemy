    Fixed regression introduced in 2.0.20 via :ticket:`9600` fix which
    attempted to add more formal typing to
    :paramref:`_schema.MetaData.naming_convention`. This change prevented basic
    naming convention dictionaries from passing typing and has been adjusted so
    that a plain dictionary of strings for keys as well as dictionaries that
    use constraint types as keys or a mix of both, are again accepted.

    As part of this change, lesser used forms of the naming convention
    dictionary are also typed, including that it currently allows for
    ``Constraint`` type objects as keys as well.
