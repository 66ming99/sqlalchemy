    Made the contained type for :class:`.Mapped` covariant; this is to allow
    greater flexibility for end-user typing scenarios, such as the use of
    protocols to represent particular mapped class structures that are passed
    to other functions. As part of this change, the contained type was also
    made covariant for dependent and related types such as
    :class:`_orm.base.SQLORMOperations`, :class:`_orm.WriteOnlyMapped`, and
    :class:`_sql.SQLColumnExpression`. Pull request courtesy Roméo Després.
