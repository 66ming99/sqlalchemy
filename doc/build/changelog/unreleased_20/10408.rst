    Fixed issue where referring to a FROM entry in the SET clause of an UPDATE
    statement would not include it in the FROM clause of the UPDATE statement,
    if that entry were nowhere else in the statement; this occurs currently for
    CTEs that were added using :meth:`.Update.add_cte` to provide the desired
    CTE at the top of the statement.
